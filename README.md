# Completed-Projects
Welcome! This repository showcases several of the projects I've worked on as a Data Science major with a concentration in Mathematics. Each project reflects my technical skills and passion for data-driven problem-solving, covering areas such as data analysis, machine learning, statistical modeling, and algorithm development. If youâ€™re exploring my work as a potential employer, I hope you enjoy seeing how I approach complex challenges through code. Thank you for taking the time to review my portfolio!
